# Anagrams
Python program that chooses a 6-letter word at random from the lexicon and displays it to the user in a random, scrambled order. Then lets the user guess words of varying lengths that can be formed with the letters of the word. After every guess, responds to the user whether the guess was correct, and adds it to the list of words that have been guessed so far. Prints results grouped by length of words.

No command-line arguments (length of sys.argv is 1): Run the guessing game with a random six-letter word from the dictionary.

One command-line argument (length of sys.argv is 2): Use the argument (sys.argv[1] as the base word instead of choosing a random six-letter word from the dictionary.
